# Terraform Ceph provider

This Terraform provider is used to manage Ceph. It is created at CERN and
is currently used to configure Ceph in addition to Puppet. It is not in any way
complete for any usage (if you want to add your use case to this provider feel
free to contribute though!).

For more details about how to use the provider you can check out the `docs/`
directory.
